    const completionPercentage = studentProgress.completionPercentage;
    
    // Predict next required content
    const nextContent = this.predictNextContent(
      currentGrade, 
      currentSubject, 
      completionPercentage
    );
    
    // Pre-load in background when online
    if (navigator.onLine) {
      this.backgroundLoad(nextContent);
    }
  }
  
  // Smart caching based on curriculum sequence
  cacheCurriculumSequence(grade, subject) {
    const odishaBoardSequence = this.getOdishaBoardSequence(grade, subject);
    
    // Cache next 3 modules in sequence
